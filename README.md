- Dynamic Menu Categories: The menu page showcases dynamic category changes facilitated by JSON file utilization and JavaScript fetching methods. This allows for swift and responsive updates based on user interaction.

The project is built using the following technologies:

- **JavaScript**: Used for the interactive functionality and logic of the application.
- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Styles the user interface to ensure an attractive and user-friendly design.
